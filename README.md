Final Project Overview

Overview

You are to form an agile software engineering team with the task of creating a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application. Your task is to create a forum like application where users can create accounts, log in, create posts, etc. The domain of your project is entirely up to your team. You could try to recreate a more general social media forum like reddit, imgur, etc. Alternatively, you could have an application with a more specific domain, such as an application which allows computer science students to make posts offering or looking for tutoring services.

Your team will have a total of 5 sprints, each 2 weeks long. During each sprint (except for the first), you will have a minimum of 5 meetings: 1 sprint planning, 1 sprint retrospective, and a minimum of 3 standups. At the end of each sprint, a member of your group must submit the specific deliverables for your sprint along with a link to your GitHub repository with the next version of your application.

Groups

You will form groups of 4 to 6 members. You are required to work in a group and cannot work alone. Each member of the team will be cross-functional -- meaning every member of the team will take part in product management (coming up with and prioritizing features for the product), project management (facilitating and participating in meetings and keeping up with the board), and engineering (software development). Note that each member of the team is required to contribute to all roles and everyone must write code. We will grade this team participation based on the meeting documents and git commits turned in at the end of each sprint.

If you have any difficulty with your group, you are strongly encouraged to reach out to the instructional team as soon as possible so we can help you address any issues. I have had my fair share of horrible group projects, so I will be very sympathetic and responsive to any issues you are having as long as you reach out early.

You cannot pass this project by relying entirely on your group and not contributing.

Project Requirements

You will create a web application forum, the domain of which is up to your team. Your web application must contain the following features by the end of the semester:

- Be developed in Python and Flask
- User signup, login, and session
- A minimum of three CRUD resources (including a user resource) with relationships between them and with related database tables (ex. post and comment)
- Several pages/views (view all posts, view single post, create, edit, etc.)
- Consistent styling using a CSS framework like Bootstrap and/or custom CSS
- A test suite at least covering the fundamental features
- At least one "extra" feature, such as:
    * Asynchronous JavaScript to get data from the server for dynamic content without reloading the page
    * Deploying your app to the cloud (ex. Heroku)
    * Utilizing DevOps for automated testing and/or deployment
    * Integrating with an external API (ex. Google Maps)
    * Using a machine learning model on the backend
    * Implementing real auth with an external provider (ex. Google login with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect) etc. -- if you have another idea, just ask me if it is enough to be considered an "extra" feature

Depending on your project's domain, you may be unsure if your features truly fit the requirements. Remember that you can always ask us at any time if the features in your project would fulfill the requirements.

Sprint Deliverables

Each sprint, except for sprint 0, will require that the 5 sprint meeting documents are turned in. In addition, each sprint has its own goals and documents.
