Statement of Purpose

Our vision is to create an immersive, interactive, and inclusive online table-top gaming platform that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming forums. We aim to bring together gamers from all walks of life, providing them with a space to connect, collaborate, and embark on thrilling adventures in their favorite games. Whether it’s D&D, Gloomhaven, or your own original ruleset, our web app will offer a seamless experience from recruiting fellow players to--once connected--initiating game sessions equipped with a dedicated chat room and the ability to upload gameboards, maps, or other documents of your choosing to enrich the story experience. We envision a world where logistics and hardware no longer limit the joy of table-top/pen-and-paper adventuring and every new campaign is just a browser away.

Problem Context

Popular online chat platforms make playing table-top/board games virtually challenging due to a lack of integrated features and tools. Additionally, geographical barriers and busy schedules often stand in the way of communication and team-building. Finding a community of like-minded people who share your interests isn’t always easy. And even if you find people to play with, coordinating gameplay becomes another hurdle to overcome.

Key Hypothesis

Our web app allows users to connect with each other and conduct group sessions with live-chat functionality. Other platforms that allow users to interact do not necessarily include the ability to seek out new connections, and even if so, are often gated behind a paywall. Our product gives gamers the ability to broadcast their LFG to forum-styled community where games can be discussed and group sessions can be planned. Users can add each other as friends and add their friends to groups in order to participate in live gaming sessions. Also, we offer dark mode as default--'nuff said.
